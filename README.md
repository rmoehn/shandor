Gives emails a shelf life and deletes them when they're expired.


## Summary

My email archive has three main categories of emails:

 - Emails that I read once and won't need ever again.

 - Emails that are only relevant for a short period of time (up to a year) and
   not needed after that.

 - Emails that have value (to me) for a long time (more than a year).

Shandor takes charge of the first two categories by actually deleting those
emails at the right time.

For that I tag my emails using [notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org). Every day
Shandor looks into the notmuch database and figures out what to do with each
email based on its tags. Emails with the tag `deleted` are actually deleted after
two weeks. Emails with the tag `1w` or `6m` are going to be tagged as `deleted`
after one week or six months, respectively.


## Usage

**WARNING** This program deletes files. *Deletes* them. It is supposed to do so
in an orderly fashion, but I don't give any guarantees that it might not delete
your whole email folder. Read the code and make backups before you run it.

**Download and compile** the code.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/rmoehn/shandor
$ cd shandor
$ lein uberjar
```

Then, **every day**, run:

```shell
$ java -jar target/shandor-<current version>.jar <path to directory with notmuch DB>
$ notmuch new
```

Shandor will do the following:

 - Emails with tag **`deleted`**: mark them for removal in two weeks.

 - Emails with a **time-to-live**, i.e. tag `Nd`, `Nw`, `Nm` or `Ny`, where `N`
   is a natural number: mark them for expiry in `N` days, weeks, months or
   years.

 - Emails that are **expired**: mark them for removal in two weeks.

 - Emails whose **removal date** lies in the **past**: actually delete them.

Right now, Shandor only deletes the **email files** from disk and not the
corresponding entries in the **database**. `notmuch new` takes care of that.


## Comments

Based on the same thoughts as [Moirai](https://github.com/rmoehn/moirai).

Right now the code is pretty horrible and there are no tests. And I'm not sure
whether one day it will delete all my emails. Good that I have backups. Anyway,
I think shelf lives are pretty awesome.

Contains a half-arsed wrapper for accessing the notmuch library from Clojure, as
well as an undocumented function to make the use of
[clojure-jna](https://github.com/Chouser/clojure-jna) more idiomatic. If you're
wanting to do useful Clojure programming, but don't know what to do, feel free
to take these and make them better and publish/contribute them.
