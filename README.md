Gives emails a shelf life and deletes them when they're expired.

Relies on [notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org).

Based on the same thoughts as [Moirai](https://github.com/rmoehn/moirai).

Right now the code is pretty horrible and usability is near zero. And I'm not
sure whether one day it will delete all my emails. Good that I have backups.
Anyway, I think shelflives are pretty awesome.

See [The Web of Alexandria](http://worrydream.com/TheWebOfAlexandria/) and [The
Web of Alexandria (follow-up)](http://worrydream.com/TheWebOfAlexandria/2.html).

Also contains a half-arsed wrapper for accessing the notmuch library from
Clojure as well as an undocumented function to make the use of
[clojure-jna](https://github.com/Chouser/clojure-jna) more idiomatic. If you're
wanting to do useful Clojure programming, but don't know what to do, feel free
to take these and make them better and publish/contribute them.
